  <p>
    Beyond Quality is a collaborative research community focused on advancing software quality practices through open discussion and shared knowledge. We believe in evidence-based approaches and transparent collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our work happens primarily on <a href="https://github.com/BeyondQuality/beyondquality">GitHub</a>, where discussions evolve into documented artifacts. Every three weeks, we record a podcast to share insights and findings with the broader community.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are currently practicing two activity types: <a href="/talk">talk prep</a> and <a href="/research">research</a>. We follow our <a href="/coc">Code of Conduct</a> in all activities.
