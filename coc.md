# Code of conduct

1. **We are respectful**. Treat everyone with kindness. We are here to collaborate and collaboration rarely works well when people are unkind. Personal attacks, harassment, or hate speech will not be tolerated.
2. **We are inclusive**. Collaboration prospers when there's a diversity of thought. We welcome diverse perspectives. We avoid language or actions that exclude or belittle others.
3. **We are constructive**. Collaboration is working together, and working together means putting in effort with the desire to help improve the current item. We share feedback thoughtfully, and keep discussions focused on ideas, not on individuals.
4. **We assume good intent**. If we see information which challenges our assumptions or beliefs, we assume respect and constructivity.
5. **We do not spam**. We are here to collaborate, and all the discussions should be on-topic.
6. **Enforcement**. Violations may result in a warning, temporary suspension, or removal.
