# Beyond Quality, The QA/QE Community of Practice

## What

A collaborative _workspace_ where QA/QE professionals take the work they're already doing — research, talk and article prep, problem-solving — and make it better, faster, and shared.

## Why

On most forums and platforms like Reddit, conversations are fleeting — ideas get buried, and there's no guarantee of follow-through.

Beyond Quality is a _working_ community, not just a talking one. Here, QA/QE professionals collaborate on research, prepare talks, solve real problems, and document the results so they become lasting, reusable resources. Instead of just sharing opinions or posting articles, you co-create something more valuable — and you get credit for your contributions.

## Who it's for

- QA/QE practitioners who want to sharpen their skills while saving time.
- Speakers and writers looking to refine their talks and articles through peer feedback.
- Problem-solvers who enjoy diagnosing testing challenges and finding better solutions.
- Learners who want to grow by working alongside experienced professionals.
