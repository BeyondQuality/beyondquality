# Beyond Quality, The QA/QE Community of Practice

## What

A collaborative _workspace_ where QA/QE professionals take the work they're already doing: research, talk and article prep, problem-solving — and make it better, faster, and shared.

## Why

This community is for quality professionals who want to go above and beyond their jobs. We strive to master our craft, challenge assumptions, and push the discipline forward **together**. Beyond Quality is for those who can't stop asking why.

On most forums and platforms like Reddit, conversations are fleeting, ideas get buried, and there’s no guarantee of follow-through.

Beyond Quality is a **working** community, not just a talking one. Here, QA/QE professionals collaborate on research, prepare talks, solve real problems, and document the results so they become lasting, reusable resources. By working together, we all can save time while producing higher-quality results, and get credit for the contributions (for example, by being listed in published whitepapers).

## Who it's for

- QA/QE practitioners who want to sharpen their skills while saving time.
- Speakers and writers looking to refine their talks and articles through peer feedback.
- Problem-solvers who enjoy diagnosing testing challenges and finding better solutions.
- Learners who want to grow by working alongside experienced professionals.

## How

We work in the open. Instead of siloed efforts that vanish after they’re done, we collaborate on the following activities:

1. **[Research & Writing](research.md)**. Join ongoing projects like Economics of Testing and contribute resources, insights, and reviews. Improve your profile as a thought leader while producing open, reusable research.
	
2. **[Talk Preparation](talk.md)**. Present your talk ideas, get expert feedback, and refine them into conference-ready sessions. Help others do the same — and get recognized for your input.

3. **Problem-Solving Sessions**. Bring real QA/QE challenges and work through solutions as a group. Learn diagnostic techniques and decision-making frameworks you can use in your job.

4. **Product Feedback & Testing**. Participate in early access programs and influence the tools you use — while being part of a trusted inner circle.

You choose how to participate: just observe, throw in some links and ideas, partner with someone else's research, or start your own.

For now, our home base is [BeyondQuality GitHub](https://github.com/sharovatov/beyondquality/): simple, open, and transparent. As we grow, we'll self-organize into Zoom calls, chats, or even physical gatherings.
