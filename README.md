# Beyond Quality

## Who we are

We are a community of technology professionals, who care about helping each other master our craft. 

Solving difficult problems in the pursuit of mastery can be a lonely task, but it need not be. Collaboration makes this work easier, more effective and fun.

Here are our core beliefs:
1. We are travellers on a journey of continuous improvement.
2. We go beyond the obvious and the superficial to discover deeper truths.
3. We grow by helping others with care and generosity.
4. We build and collaborate in public.
5. We create the whole, that is greater than the sum of individual parts.

This community is open to any tech professional who wants to bring depth and rigour into solving problems. We love inter-disciplinary collaboration. We aren't limited to quality specialists, but we all care about the quality of our work.

## What we do here

Beyond Quality is a collaborative, public workspace. We share our project with the community and invite collaborators. 

Examples of the kind of work we do here:
1. **[Research & Writing](research.md)**: Pursue interesting problems deeper, and uncover insights that are hidden beneath the surface. Share these insights though discussions, articles, blogs and white papers.
2. **[Talk Preparation](talk.md)**: Present your talk or workshop ideas, get expert feedback and refine them into conference-ready sessions. Help others do the same, and get recognized for your input.
3. **Problem-Solving Sessions**. Problem-Solving Sessions: Share a problem that you are dealing with at work and get help from the community to solve it. Learn from the experience of others and pay it forward.

But these are just examples. You choose how you wish to participate: just observe, throw in some links and ideas, partner with someone else’s research, or start your own.

## Where we work

For now, our home base is [BeyondQuality GitHub](https://github.com/BeyondQuality/beyondquality): simple, open, and transparent. 

As we grow, we’ll self-organize into Zoom calls, chats, or even physical gatherings. The discussions we have on our GitHub page will form the basis for synchronous collaboration online or in-person.
