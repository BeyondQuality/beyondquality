Vitaly: I've taken liberty to categorise the current advise given by so many great people.

## The "whys"

From the discussion: these are the reasons why people started presenting.

### 1. Challenge yourself / build courage

@mesutdurukal: Challenge myself. Public speaking is not easy; it requires social courage. Once you start, it gets easier, but the first step is scary. I just wanted to close my eyes and push myself into the sea.

### 2. Travel & fun

@mesutdurukal: Since I'm already in a new country or a beautiful city, why not spare a few days for sightseeing?

@PerJonasHermansson: I speak at conferences because I truly enjoy it ... most importantly — it's fun! It's an opportunity to strengthen both my own and my company's brand ... and most importantly — it's fun!

@PIIARSoftware: I love the confereces. The vibe, atmosphere… Smile beats the fear, have a story to tell and share it with the room.

### 3. Networking, visibility, personal brand & career growth

@mesutdurukal: Increasing visibility and meeting new people. It helps grow your network.

@anupamck: Speaking at a conference also lends credibility to my work.

@bischoffdev: Speaking at a conference has a lot of benefits for your personal development and your career ... you expose both your personal and your company brand.

@oren-reshef: One of the requirements for senior level is public speaking.

@maaretp: Finding new jobs and career opportunities: introductions from the stage done right turn into higher career progression


### 4. Increase diversity of thought & exposure to trends

@mesutdurukal: Even just seeing the topics helps you understand the most common problems other people are facing, which tools are becoming popular, and the latest trends.


### 5. Teaching is the best learning / deepen expertise

@ClaraRamosGonzalez: Teaching is the best way of learning, I've learned a lot and improved my own work when designing the talks.

@bischoffdev: By thinking about it, reading about it and constantly reflecting on potential questions that could be asked, you slowly but surely turn into an expert of this topic.


### 6. Fixing social awkwardness

@maaretp: Fixing socially awkward: when you speak, they come talk to you. Meeting strangers is hard except when introducing yourself with a talk on stage.


### 7. Happiness & self-esteem (eudaimonia)

@sharovatov: Speaking at conferences contributes a lot to my eudaimonia ... presenting can compensate for lack of social appreciation at work → recognition → self-esteem → greater happiness → productivity.


### 8. Giving back to the community

@anupamck: Sharing my learnings at a conference is a small opportunity for me to give back.


### 9. Pedagogical urge / ethical drive

@sharovatov: I have this ethical belief that if I can make the world a little better by sharing what I know, then I should.


### 10. Representation & diversity

@maaretp: Represent Finland, represent women, represent people speaking from experiences.


### 11. Authentic expression / theatre roots

Rahul Verma (via @maryiat): I grew up on stage as a theatre actor. Conferences became the closest thing to theatre while staying a testing professional.


### 12. Free access to conferences

@maaretp: At least you did not have to pay full price to attend if you deliver a talk.

@bischoffdev: Let's not forget that as a conference speaker you not only get to visit conferences for free, but you also make a lot of new friends there.

## The "hows"

From the discussion: prep advice from very experienced speakers.

## Presentation skills general prep advice

### 1. Breathing exercises & grounding techniques

@mesutdurukal: breathing exercise helps a lot
@sharovatov: breathing exercises for the nerves, voice projection drills to build "presence", simple "grounding techniques" to feel better

### 2. Don't focus on slides, focus on story

Rahul Verma: Slides aren't the point; the conversation in the room is. 
@PIIARSoftware: Sometimes good vibes and what you say gives 80% of the value, not the slides that fly behind you. 

### 3. Plan for interaction

@mesutdurukal: Make it interactive. Ask small questions, encourage them to vote.
@PerJonasHermansson: Think of it as entertainment with added value: knowledge.

### 4. Admit what you don't know

@bischoffdev: Don't be afraid to admit when you don't know something—it's much better than stumbling through. 
@mesutdurukal: Saying I don't know shouldn't be difficult. 

### 5. Practice with peers for early feedback

@anupamck: I always end up recording my presentations several times... I also gather feedback from other people (especially my wife).
@lisacrispin: Pair up with a colleague to do sessions. Two heads are better than one! It helps a lot with nerves. 
@mesutdurukal: Feedback! I learnt a lot from the feedback I got after my talks or rehearsals.
@mesutdurukal: Feedback... You don't realize basic things that others do.
Rahul Verma: Some ideas won't land, so I iterate. I design for imperfection.

### 6. Practice timing & pacing

@sharovatov: Practicing conscious slowing-down exercises... I forced myself to silently count to 5 before each next line.
@bischoffdev: Successful talk delivery starts with thorough preparation, including practicing your pacing, timing, and especially your opening and closing sentences. 
@rgroetz2: Be on time. It's embarrassing for the speakers after you if you take longer. 

### 7. Enjoy yourself

@PerJonasHermansson: When you're having fun, the audience will too. 
@PIIARSoftware: Enjoy the process, have fun with preparations, be happy and have pleasure being on stage. 
@PIIARSoftware: Smile beats the fear... You are a live example of your story.

### 8. Be honest & authentic (don't sell)

@ClaraRamosGonzalez: Be honest, don't try to sell, try to communicate. 
@rgroetz2: The audience deserves authenticity, and that's what builds trust and makes a talk memorable. 
Rahul Verma: I don't present to please. I present an idea, trusting that somewhere in the room my audience sits. 

Rahul Verma: Talk to the audience, not at a topic.

### 9. Overcome self-doubt (I don't have anything to say”)

@bischoffdev: Don't let the thought ‘I don't have anything to add' hold you back. 

### 10. Design for imperfection / accept failure

Rahul Verma: I start from the idea that this talk is going to fail... treat the submitted idea as a hypothesis and let it evolve. 

### 11. Body language, voice, emotional connection

@PepeDiaz: Your spoken words and body language are key... entertain, captivate, and take people on a journey. 

@sharovatov: Voice projection drills to build presence. 


## Storytelling & Talk structure

### 1. Decide on the core message upfront

@PerJonasHermansson: Start by deciding what message you want to convey.

### 2. Hero's journey / villain archetype

@rgroetz2: My talks always follow a kind of hero's journey... there's a villain ... and the hero learns and overcomes.

### 3. Hook → Situation → Complication → Solution (SCS)

@rgroetz2: Start with a hook—something surprising, funny, or thought-provoking. 
@anupamck: I try and get my audience to pay attention with a hook... situation, complication, solution. 

### 4. Problem-solution framing

@mesutdurukal: Almost always, it is a problem-solution pattern.

### 5. Adapt language to the audience

@bischoffdev: Be inclusive in your language and adapt your presentation style to your audience.
