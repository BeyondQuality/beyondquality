I've taken liberty to categorise the current advise given by so many great people.

First, on the "whys".

---

1. Challenge yourself / build courage

@mesutdurukal:

> Challenge myself. Public speaking is not easy; it requires social courage. Once you start, it gets easier, but the first step is scary. I just wanted to close my eyes and push myself into the sea.


2. Travel & fun

@mesutdurukal:

> Since I'm already in a new country or a beautiful city, why not spare a few days for sightseeing?

@PerJonasHermansson:

> I speak at conferences because I truly enjoy it ... most importantly — it's fun!
> It's an opportunity to strengthen both my own and my company's brand ... and most importantly — it's fun!

@PIIARSoftware:

> I love the confereces. The vibe, atmosphere… Smile beats the fear, have a story to tell and share it with the room.

3. Networking, visibility, personal brand & career growth

@mesutdurukal:

> Increasing visibility and meeting new people. It helps grow your network.

@anupamck:

> Speaking at a conference also lends credibility to my work.

@bischoffdev:

> Speaking at a conference has a lot of benefits for your personal development and your career ... you expose both your personal and your company brand.

@oren-reshef:

> One of the requirements for senior level is public speaking.

@maaretp:

> Finding new jobs and career opportunities: introductions from the stage done right turn into higher career progression


4. Increase diversity of thought & exposure to trends

@mesutdurukal:

> Even just seeing the topics helps you understand the most common problems other people are facing, which tools are becoming popular, and the latest trends.


5. Teaching is the best learning / deepen expertise

@ClaraRamosGonzalez:

> Teaching is the best way of learning, I've learned a lot and improved my own work when designing the talks.

@bischoffdev:

> By thinking about it, reading about it and constantly reflecting on potential questions that could be asked, you slowly but surely turn into an expert of this topic.


6. Fixing social awkwardness

@maaretp:

> Fixing socially awkward: when you speak, they come talk to you. Meeting strangers is hard except when introducing yourself with a talk on stage.


7. Happiness & self-esteem (eudaimonia)

@sharovatov:

> Speaking at conferences contributes a lot to my eudaimonia ... presenting can compensate for lack of social appreciation at work → recognition → self-esteem → greater happiness → productivity.


8. Giving back to the community

@anupamck:

> Sharing my learnings at a conference is a small opportunity for me to give back.


9. Pedagogical urge / ethical drive

@sharovatov:

> I have this ethical belief that if I can make the world a little better by sharing what I know, then I should.


10. Representation & diversity

@maaretp:

> Represent Finland, represent women, represent people speaking from experiences.


11. Authentic expression / theatre roots

Rahul Verma (via @maryiat):

> I grew up on stage as a theatre actor. Conferences became the closest thing to theatre while staying a testing professional.


12. Free access to conferences

@maaretp:

> At least you did not have to pay full price to attend if you deliver a talk.

@bischoffdev: 

> Let's not forget that as a conference speaker you not only get to visit conferences for free, but you also make a lot of new friends there.
