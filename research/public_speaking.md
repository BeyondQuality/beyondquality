## The "whys"

From the discussion: these are the reasons why people started presenting.

### 1. Challenge yourself / build courage

@mesutdurukal: Challenge myself. Public speaking is not easy; it requires social courage. Once you start, it gets easier, but the first step is scary. I just wanted to close my eyes and push myself into the sea.

### 2. Travel & fun

@lisacrispin: I started speaking at conferences in order to GO to conferences, so I could learn and meet people. I also volunteered and did everything I could to get to them, because my employers couldn't or wouldn't pay for me to go.

@Lisacrispin: Instead of being totally stressed out every workshop, I started to have fun. It's still stressful for me, and I'm exhausted at the end. But I get to recharge by getting to attend other sessions and meet awesome people.

@mesutdurukal: Since I'm already in a new country or a beautiful city, why not spare a few days for sightseeing?

@PerJonasHermansson: I speak at conferences because I truly enjoy it ... most importantly — it's fun! It's an opportunity to strengthen both my own and my company's brand ... and most importantly — it's fun!

@PIIARSoftware: I love the confereces. The vibe, atmosphere… Smile beats the fear, have a story to tell and share it with the room.

### 3. Networking, visibility, personal brand & career growth

@mesutdurukal: Increasing visibility and meeting new people. It helps grow your network.

@anupamck: Speaking at a conference also lends credibility to my work.

@bischoffdev: Speaking at a conference has a lot of benefits for your personal development and your career ... you expose both your personal and your company brand.

@oren-reshef: One of the requirements for senior level is public speaking.

@sharovatov: Public reputation or a clear personal brand is a great proactive signal which is almost always received and considered at the earliest hiring stage, at the CV selection stage. This is why I believe it's clearly beneficial to invest in public speaking (presenting at conferences, meetups, etc).

@PepeDiaz: For some, it’s a step toward greater recognition within their company or professional life, or even a way to connect with a new employer.

@maaretp: Finding new jobs and career opportunities: introductions from the stage done right turn into higher career progression if you manage the time at work vs time at conferences. My jobs have come from networks speaking cultivates.

@maaretp: Entrepreneurial side gigs: Teaching can be a way of making a living too and conferences are ways of introducing you as someone with knowledge to teach or consult on.

### 4. Increase diversity of thought & exposure to trends

@mesutdurukal: Even just seeing the topics helps you understand the most common problems other people are facing, which tools are becoming popular, and the latest trends.

@maaretp: Represent Finland, represent women, represent people speaking from experiences.

### 5. Teaching is the best learning / deepen expertise

@ClaraRamosGonzalez: Teaching is the best way of learning, I've learned a lot and improved my own work when designing the talks.

@bischoffdev: By thinking about it, reading about it and constantly reflecting on potential questions that could be asked, you slowly but surely turn into an expert of this topic.

@maaretp: I have learned a lot and many people could learn from what I did so far, and I am not done learning. 

### 6. Fixing social awkwardness

@maaretp: Fixing sociall awkwardness: when you speak, they come talk to you. Meeting strangers is hard except when introducing yourself with a talk on stage.

### 7. Happiness & self-esteem (eudaimonia)

@sharovatov: Speaking at conferences contributes a lot to my eudaimonia ... presenting can compensate for lack of social appreciation at work → recognition → self-esteem → greater happiness → productivity.


### 8. Giving back to and being part of the community

@anupamck: Sharing my learnings at a conference is a small opportunity for me to give back.

@PepeDiaz: Some people want to share their knowledge and experiences. Others see speaking as a way to get more involved in the community.

@maaretp: Speakers dinners and the connections in the speaker community: you learn a bit from talks, but you learn tons from other speakers. And speakers hang out together.

### 9. Pedagogical urge / ethical drive

@sharovatov: I have this ethical belief that if I can make the world a little better by sharing what I know, then I should.


### 10. Authentic expression / theatre roots

Rahul Verma (via @maryiat): I grew up on stage as a theatre actor. Conferences became the closest thing to theatre while staying a testing professional.


### 10. Free access to conferences

@maaretp: At least you did not have to pay full price to attend if you deliver a talk.

@bischoffdev: Let's not forget that as a conference speaker you not only get to visit conferences for free, but you also make a lot of new friends there.

## The "hows"

From the discussion: prep advice from very experienced speakers.

## Presentation skills general prep advice

### 1. Breathing exercises & grounding techniques

@mesutdurukal: breathing exercise helps a lot

@sharovatov: breathing exercises for the nerves, voice projection drills to build "presence", simple "grounding techniques" to feel better

@sharovatov: In my first three-four years of public speaking I was always rushing. Rushing to such a degree that I was losing my breath. I significantly improved the situation by practicing conscious slowing-down exercises, they were quite simple. For instance, I wrote myself 10 lines to practice with, and I forced myself to silently count to 5 before each next line. Or, for the same 10 lines, I had to walk two-three steps after each line.

### 2. Don't focus on slides, focus on story

Rahul Verma: Slides aren't the point; the conversation in the room is. 

@PIIARSoftware: Sometimes good vibes and what you say gives 80% of the value, not the slides that fly behind you. 

### 3. Plan for interaction

@mesutdurukal: Make it interactive. Ask small questions, encourage them to vote.

@PerJonasHermansson: Think of it as entertainment with added value: knowledge.

### 4. Admit what you don't know

@bischoffdev: Don't be afraid to admit when you don't know something—it's much better than stumbling through. 

@mesutdurukal: Saying I don't know shouldn't be difficult. 

### 5. Practice with peers for early feedback

@anupamck: I always end up recording my presentations several times... I also gather feedback from other people (especially my wife).

@lisacrispin: Pair up with a colleague to do sessions. Two heads are better than one! It helps a lot with nerves. I put in more effort because I don't want to let my pair down. If I do screw up, my pair has my back. Together we make a better learning experience for our participants. In the past 12 years, I've paired with newbie speakers who are having trouble getting their proposals accepted at conferences. I usually get invited to conferences so I say, "Great, this person will be co-facilitating with me, will you comp her as well?" and they almost always say yes. If they say no, I don't go. I let my pair pick the topic, which means I usually get to learn all about some area that I wasn't too familiar with! And the newbies I paired with have gone on to much better speaking careers than my own.

@mesutdurukal: Feedback! I learnt a lot from the feedback I got after my talks or rehearsals. You don't realize basic things that others do.

Rahul Verma: Some ideas won't land, so I iterate. I design for imperfection.

@maaretp: Practice makes better: smaller audiences, but also forced audiences (university students) with topics you are most comfortable with.

### 6. Practice timing & pacing

@sharovatov: Practicing conscious slowing-down exercises... I forced myself to silently count to 5 before each next line.

@bischoffdev: Successful talk delivery starts with thorough preparation, including practicing your pacing, timing, and especially your opening and closing sentences. 

@rgroetz2: Be on time. It's embarrassing for the speakers after you if you take longer. 

### 7. Enjoy yourself

@PerJonasHermansson: When you're having fun, the audience will too. 

@PIIARSoftware: Enjoy the process, have fun with preparations, be happy and have pleasure being on stage. 

@PIIARSoftware: Smile beats the fear... You are a live example of your story.

@rgroetz2: If I enjoy myself on stage, the audience usually does too

### 8. Be honest & authentic (don't sell)

@ClaraRamosGonzalez: Be honest, don't try to sell, try to communicate. 

@rgroetz2: The audience deserves authenticity, and that's what builds trust and makes a talk memorable. 

Rahul Verma: I don't present to please. I present an idea, trusting that somewhere in the room my audience sits. 

Rahul Verma: Talk to the audience, not at a topic.

### 9. Overcome self-doubt (I don't have anything to say”)

@bischoffdev: Don't let the thought ‘I don't have anything to add' hold you back. 

### 10. Design for imperfection / accept failure

Rahul Verma: I start from the idea that this talk is going to fail... treat the submitted idea as a hypothesis and let it evolve. 

### 11. Body language, voice, emotional connection

@PepeDiaz: Your spoken words and body language are key. When you step on stage, the audience expects more than just information. They expect a story. A good speaker entertains, captivates, and takes people on a journey.

@sharovatov: Voice projection drills to build presence. 

### 12. Imposter syndrome
@mesutdurukal: Beat your imposter syndrome. I know a good way for this: Embrace the idea that you are not claiming to teach people something they don't know. You are going to share your story. Ok, now you are safe, no one can better know your story.

@sharovatov: We humans are social creatures, and standing in front of a room full of eyes locked on us taps into some very old instincts. We value social approval, and consciously or not, we're asking ourselves: is my content good enough, or is it just banal? Most people outgrow this fear with experience and gradually become more natural on stage. 


## Storytelling & Talk structure

### 1. Decide on the core message upfront

@PerJonasHermansson: Start by deciding what message you want to convey.

### 2. Hero's journey / villain archetype

@rgroetz2: My talks always follow a kind of hero's journey... there's a villain ... and the hero learns and overcomes.

### 3. Hook → Situation → Complication → Solution (SCS)

@rgroetz2: Start with a hook—something surprising, funny, or thought-provoking. 

@anupamck: I try and get my audience to pay attention with a hook... situation, complication, solution. 

### 4. Problem-solution framing

@mesutdurukal: Almost always, it is a problem-solution pattern.

### 5. Adapt language to the audience

@bischoffdev: Be inclusive in your language and adapt your presentation style to your audience.
