## Introduction

I still remember the first time I stood up to speak at a local tech meetup. My heart was pounding, and I wondered what I’d gotten myself into. As an engineer in the tech industry (and a tester at my inner core), I had always been more comfortable behind a screen than on a stage. Public speaking felt intimidating. Over time, however, I discovered that sharing my ideas in front of an audience was one of the most rewarding decisions of my career. In this short book, I want to share my journey and hard-earned lessons about speaking at meetups and conferences. My goal is to help beginner speakers: engineers, testers, managers, anyone in tech – gain the confidence and know-how to step up to the microphone. 

Public speaking is a skill, not an innate talent. In fact, fear of public speaking is extremely common.  Up to 75% of people [1] experience “glossophobia”, the anxiety around giving speeches. I was definitely one of them. If you feel nervous about speaking, you’re in good company. As the famous Mark Twain quipped, “There are only two types of speakers: the nervous and the liars”. In other words, even seasoned presenters get the jitters. They’ve just learned to cope with it. The good news is that anyone can learn to speak effectively with practice and preparation. I certainly didn’t start out as a confident speaker, but through experience I improve little by little. Each talk becomes easier than the last. 

This guide is organized into three parts. In Part 1, we’ll explore the "Why’s". Why people choose to present and why I decided to start speaking. Knowing your motivation can inspire you to take this challenge. Part 2 is about the "How’s" of preparation. How to craft a great tech presentation, from choosing a topic to rehearsing. Part 3 covers how to deliver your presentation smoothly on the day. Dealing with stage fright, engaging the audience, and handling Q&A. Throughout, I’ll share personal anecdotes, practical tips, a few checklists and the best advice from my colleagues (from complete beginners to speaking gurus). 

Whether you’re a QA tester who’s never spoken beyond team meetings, a junior developer thinking of giving a lightning talk, or a manager asked to present at an industry conference, this guide is for you. By the end, I hope you’ll feel that public speaking in tech is not only doable, but possibly even enjoyable. It’s okay to be nervous. Feeling that way just means you care about doing a good job. With that, let’s start by examining the big question: why even do public speaking in the first place?

## The "whys"

Why would a busy tech professional bother to prepare a talk and speak in front of an audience? The answers will vary for everyone, but understanding the “why” is important. In my case, I stumbled into public speaking almost by accident. I was attending a testing meetup where I heard an inspiring talk about a new automation approach. After the session, I ended up in a conversation with the speaker. He encouraged me to share my experiences in testing, saying that even as a newcomer I had valuable insights. My first reaction was, “Who, me? What do I have to talk about?” But his encouragement planted a seed. Over the next few weeks, I realized I did have a story to tell.  A recent project where I introduced a QA lab. I decided to turn that experience into a short presentation. That small meetup talk changed my perspective, and it was the first step on my speaking journey.

One big reason people present is to share knowledge and passion. Perhaps you’ve solved a tricky problem, mastered a tool, or learned a lesson the hard way. By speaking about it, you can help others in the community. In the tech world, we thrive on shared learning. By teaching others, we also deepen our own understanding. In fact, trying to explain a topic to an audience will quickly reveal what you truly know and what you don’t. It’s a fantastic learning experience for the speaker as well. I’ve found that preparing a talk forces me to research and organize my thoughts, which makes me more expert on the subject. As the saying goes, the best way to learn something is to teach it.

Another motivation is professional growth. Public speaking is a great way to develop leadership and communication skills. Many engineers (my past self included) aren’t naturally comfortable speaking to groups. But in leadership roles or customer-facing situations, being able to present confidently is a huge advantage. Even if you’re not aiming for management, being known as someone who can articulate ideas clearly can open up career opportunities. I’ve had conferences and webinars lead to job offers and consulting inquiries, simply because speaking increases visibility. It helps establishing personal brand as a knowledgeable professional in your field.

Community and networking are also major benefits. When you speak at a conference, you often get free access to the whole event. You can attend other sessions, learn from fellow speakers, meet people you wouldn’t otherwise meet. I quickly learned that tech conferences are as much about hallway conversations as the formal talks. By standing on that stage, you become part of the conversation. Other attendees will come up to you afterward to ask questions or continue the discussion. I’ve made wonderful connections this way. In fact, as an introvert, I found that speaking actually made networking easier. It gave me a common talking point with others. Joining as a speaker made it easier to connect, because attendees will naturally start conversations with “I liked your talk…”. Those post-talk chats have inspired new ideas and even friendships. The tech community is full of bright people, and speaking puts you right in the middle of it.

There is a real satisfaction in contributing to the community. Throughout my career I’ve learned so much from blogs, open-source projects, guides and talks that others have given. At some point I realized I wanted to “give back” and share what I could, to repay that karma. When someone comes up and says “Your talk helped me”, it’s an amazing feeling. Moreover, taking the stage can boost the confidence tremendously. It’s scary, yes. I won’t pretend it isn’t. The first few times I spoke, my nerves were through the roof. But doing something scary and surviving it is how you grow. Public speaking was one of the scariest things I’d ever done, but pushing beyond my comfort zone proved to be immensely rewarding. Each successful talk made me more confident not just in speaking, but in tackling other challenges too. It’s a virtuous cycle: the more you stretch yourself, the more you realize you’re capable of.

Lastly, there are some fun perks! If you speak at out-of-town conferences, you might get to travel to new places (often with expenses covered). I’ve visited cities and countries I might never have seen otherwise. It turns those business trips into mini-adventures. I explore local sights, try new foods, gain fresh perspectives, learn new culture along the way. Conferences are an escape from daily work and an opportunity to recharge creativity. Some of my conference trips have been as memorable as vacations.

Everyone’s reasons to speak will be a bit different. Maybe you want to advocate for a cause, like encouraging more diversity in tech. Maybe you have a unique testing technique you’re excited to popularize. Or maybe you simply want to challenge yourself. There’s no wrong reason. What matters is that you have one. When you know what you want to get out of speaking, it gives motivation to push through the hard work of preparation and the butterflies on stage.


### 1. Challenge yourself / build courage

@mesutdurukal: Challenge myself. Public speaking is not easy; it requires social courage. Once you start, it gets easier, but the first step is scary. I just wanted to close my eyes and push myself into the sea.

@rytmar: To overcome my fear of talk. I'm nervous when speaking, but I enjoy it! The feeling afterwards is "winner" or "rock star" type, I suppose (not sure as I'm NOT a rock star :).. The same is when I organize testing seminar in Finland. The feeling is something you do not get easily from other hobbies.


### 2. Travel & fun

@lisacrispin: I started speaking at conferences in order to GO to conferences, so I could learn and meet people. I also volunteered and did everything I could to get to them, because my employers couldn't or wouldn't pay for me to go.

@Lisacrispin: Instead of being totally stressed out every workshop, I started to have fun. It's still stressful for me, and I'm exhausted at the end. But I get to recharge by getting to attend other sessions and meet awesome people.

@mesutdurukal: Since I'm already in a new country or a beautiful city, why not spare a few days for sightseeing?

@PerJonasHermansson: I speak at conferences because I truly enjoy it ... most importantly — it's fun! It's an opportunity to strengthen both my own and my company's brand ... and most importantly — it's fun!

@PIIARSoftware: I love the confereces. The vibe, atmosphere… Smile beats the fear, have a story to tell and share it with the room.


### 3. Networking, visibility, personal brand & career growth

@mesutdurukal: Increasing visibility and meeting new people. It helps grow your network.

@anupamck: Speaking at a conference also lends credibility to my work.

@bischoffdev: Speaking at a conference has a lot of benefits for your personal development and your career ... you expose both your personal and your company brand.

@oren-reshef: One of the requirements for senior level is public speaking.

@sharovatov: Public reputation or a clear personal brand is a great proactive signal which is almost always received and considered at the earliest hiring stage, at the CV selection stage. This is why I believe it's clearly beneficial to invest in public speaking (presenting at conferences, meetups, etc).

@PepeDiaz: For some, it’s a step toward greater recognition within their company or professional life, or even a way to connect with a new employer.

@maaretp: Finding new jobs and career opportunities: introductions from the stage done right turn into higher career progression if you manage the time at work vs time at conferences. My jobs have come from networks speaking cultivates.

@maaretp: Entrepreneurial side gigs: Teaching can be a way of making a living too and conferences are ways of introducing you as someone with knowledge to teach or consult on.

@ethfeat: There are many  reasons: building your reputation, increasing your visibility, strengthening your personal brand, and opening doors to new opportunities.

@KariKakkonen: It is a natural step forward in growing as a professional - sharing with others. It gives you credibility as a professional.

@basdijkstra: It is a great form of shameless self-promotion. As an independent consultant, I'm always looking for ways to get my name out there, and public speaking is a great way of doing that. You won't see / hear me sell my services directly during a talk, but I've had plenty of people coming up to me after a talk or a conference workshop asking if I was open to coming into their company. Well, of course!

@rytmar: Get to know people and get people to know me. When you deliver talk, people will come and talk "naturally".

@rytmar: Boost my book sales. Book sales is not about money, but it may open interesting opportunities (trainings, jobs, study groups...). Book and public talks will boost your career, in a unique and personal way.


### 4. Increase diversity of thought & exposure to trends

@mesutdurukal: Even just seeing the topics helps you understand the most common problems other people are facing, which tools are becoming popular, and the latest trends.

@maaretp: Represent Finland, represent women, represent people speaking from experiences.


### 5. Teaching is the best learning / deepen expertise

@ClaraRamosGonzalez: Teaching is the best way of learning, I've learned a lot and improved my own work when designing the talks.

@bischoffdev: By thinking about it, reading about it and constantly reflecting on potential questions that could be asked, you slowly but surely turn into an expert of this topic.

@maaretp: I have learned a lot and many people could learn from what I did so far, and I am not done learning. 

@rytmar: When you create talk you really need to think it. Not just the content, but also on how to say the things. The same is when you publish a book.


### 6. Fixing social awkwardness

@maaretp: Fixing sociall awkwardness: when you speak, they come talk to you. Meeting strangers is hard except when introducing yourself with a talk on stage.


### 7. Happiness & self-esteem (eudaimonia)

@sharovatov: Speaking at conferences contributes a lot to my eudaimonia ... presenting can compensate for lack of social appreciation at work → recognition → self-esteem → greater happiness → productivity.

@KariKakkonen: It is a great way to attend a conference in a more central role than as a participant.

@basdijkstra: Because I enjoy it. I think public speaking doesn't make a lot of sense if you're not enjoying it. I myself like to share what I've learned with others, and maybe prevent them from making the same mistakes I made.


### 8. Giving back to and being part of the community

@anupamck: Sharing my learnings at a conference is a small opportunity for me to give back.

@PepeDiaz: Some people want to share their knowledge and experiences. Others see speaking as a way to get more involved in the community.

@maaretp: Speakers dinners and the connections in the speaker community: you learn a bit from talks, but you learn tons from other speakers. And speakers hang out together.

@ethfeat: Speaking can be as much about giving back to the community as it is about shaping your own professional journey.


### 9. Pedagogical urge / ethical drive

@sharovatov: I have this ethical belief that if I can make the world a little better by sharing what I know, then I should.

@ethfeat: People have many reasons for stepping on stage. For me, it has always been about sharing what I know and teaching others—there’s a special joy in passing on knowledge. On top of that, I’ve always loved being on stage, so speaking is both fun and personally rewarding.

@KariKakkonen: It is sharing for the common good; why keep your ideas to your own?

@vivianehen: Personally, I started for the wrong reasons. Colleagues of mine asked me to jump in when one of their speakers unexpectedly dropped out for health reasons. But I would say, for me I continued for the right reasons. When I discovered that I am neurodivergent (autism and ADHD), it changed my life. I had a sudden urge to help others realizing that they might be too and to educate on the topic in the general. Now, every submission has a personal message I want to spread.


### 10. Authentic expression / theatre roots

Rahul Verma (via @maryiat): I grew up on stage as a theatre actor. Conferences became the closest thing to theatre while staying a testing professional.


### 10. Free access to conferences

@maaretp: At least you did not have to pay full price to attend if you deliver a talk.

@bischoffdev: Let's not forget that as a conference speaker you not only get to visit conferences for free, but you also make a lot of new friends there.

@KariKakkonen: It is a way to attend more conferences, and thus learn and network more effectively.

@rytmar: It enables participation to the conferences. Some employers do not support that, and some supports (So happy that current ones encourages and supports)

---

## The "hows"

From the discussion: prep advice from very experienced speakers.

## Presentation skills general prep advice

### 1. Breathing exercises & grounding techniques

@mesutdurukal: breathing exercise helps a lot

@sharovatov: breathing exercises for the nerves, voice projection drills to build "presence", simple "grounding techniques" to feel better

@sharovatov: In my first three-four years of public speaking I was always rushing. Rushing to such a degree that I was losing my breath. I significantly improved the situation by practicing conscious slowing-down exercises, they were quite simple. For instance, I wrote myself 10 lines to practice with, and I forced myself to silently count to 5 before each next line. Or, for the same 10 lines, I had to walk two-three steps after each line.

@ethfeat: Delivering a great talk is more of a mental challenge than a technical one. Beyond knowing your material, you need to be mentally prepared: learn how to manage stress, handle unexpected situations, and peak at the right time.


### 2. Don't focus on slides, focus on story

Rahul Verma: Slides aren't the point; the conversation in the room is. 

@PIIARSoftware: I try to focus on 3 things. First present something that You want to show as Your achievement, be proud of that. Second, present it in a way that the audience can try it out in their ecosystem, give them some action points and a place to start. Third, have fun presenting the subject. Sometimes good vibes and what You say gives the 80% vaule of the talk not the slides that fly behind You.

@KariKakkonen: Balanced slides with enough content (for notes) but not too much (so people won't read but listen to you).

@basdijkstra: The less text there is on your slides, the better - people either read the slide or listen to you, not both


### 3. Plan for interaction

@mesutdurukal: Make it interactive. Ask small questions, encourage them to vote.

@PerJonasHermansson: Think of it as entertainment with added value: knowledge.

@KariKakkonen: Ask questions, ask for interaction during and after the talk.

@basdijkstra: I like to involve the crowd a little bit, maybe asking some questions to specific individuals, but maybe not everybody is comfortable doing that.


### 4. Admit what you don't know

@bischoffdev: Don't be afraid to admit when you don't know something—it's much better than stumbling through. 

@mesutdurukal: Saying I don't know shouldn't be difficult. 


### 5. Practice and get early feedback

@anupamck: I always end up recording my presentations several times... I also gather feedback from other people (especially my wife).

@lisacrispin: Pair up with a colleague to do sessions. Two heads are better than one! It helps a lot with nerves. I put in more effort because I don't want to let my pair down. If I do screw up, my pair has my back. Together we make a better learning experience for our participants. In the past 12 years, I've paired with newbie speakers who are having trouble getting their proposals accepted at conferences. I usually get invited to conferences so I say, "Great, this person will be co-facilitating with me, will you comp her as well?" and they almost always say yes. If they say no, I don't go. I let my pair pick the topic, which means I usually get to learn all about some area that I wasn't too familiar with! And the newbies I paired with have gone on to much better speaking careers than my own.

@mesutdurukal: Feedback! I learnt a lot from the feedback I got after my talks or rehearsals. You don't realize basic things that others do.

Rahul Verma: Some ideas won't land, so I iterate. I design for imperfection.

@maaretp: Practice makes better: smaller audiences, but also forced audiences (university students) with topics you are most comfortable with.

@RikardEdgren001: I memorize the first sentences, because if it is a good start, all will go well. I try to start with an ice breaker, quite often it is something that happened on the way to the conference (for instance when I could show my green and white socks I had to wear in Dublin when the luggage was lost).
If the presentation goes really, really well, I remember almost nothing of what I actually said.

@KariKakkonen: Memorize the main point in each slide, make the point, don't read all the slide content, or verbalize it differently.

@rytmar: Know how to start, everything else will follow


### 6. Practice timing & pacing

@sharovatov: Practicing conscious slowing-down exercises... I forced myself to silently count to 5 before each next line.

@bischoffdev: Successful talk delivery starts with thorough preparation, including practicing your pacing, timing, and especially your opening and closing sentences. 

@rgroetz2: Be on time. It's embarrassing for the speakers after you if you take longer. 

@RikardEdgren001: I write a rough script for all of my slides, but I don't follow it (unless it is an online talk, then I do it word-by-word). But writing a script gives me one way of expressing the important points, and if I forget some of them, it doesn't matter (there should be enough anyway). I also try to put some humour in there, and tend to remember those parts better.

@KariKakkonen: Be on time, start, and finish.

@basdijkstra: Speak slowly, slower than you're used to. Short pauses and silence can work very well.

@rytmar: Practice. Practice. Practice. Make sure you say everything in a time given, without hurry.

@rytmar: Be on time, not just with your body, but mentally (use 15 mins or so before to get into the mood to talk)


### 7. Enjoy yourself

@PerJonasHermansson: When you're having fun, the audience will too. 

@PIIARSoftware: Enjoy the process, have fun with preparations, be happy and have pleasure being on stage. 

@PIIARSoftware: Smile beats the fear... You are a live example of your story.

@rgroetz2: If I enjoy myself on stage, the audience usually does too

@ethfeat: Slides and visuals are just as important. They should support your message, not overload it. Use graphics, examples, or illustrations that make your point clearer and keep the audience’s attention. A talk that’s both meaningful and enjoyable is always the one people remember.


### 8. Be honest & authentic (don't sell)

@ClaraRamosGonzalez: Be honest, don't try to sell, try to communicate. 

@rgroetz2: The audience deserves authenticity, and that's what builds trust and makes a talk memorable. 

Rahul Verma: I don't present to please. I present an idea, trusting that somewhere in the room my audience sits. Talk to the audience, not at a topic.

@RikardEdgren001: Over time I found that my style was a mix of very abstract things and very concrete experiences. If it is a keynote I want something catchy and provoking. For a normal session, just my story can be enough.

@basdijkstra: I think the best talks speak from the heart and from experience. I've seen and delivered some dreadful talks that were basically regurgitating literature, platitudes and/or tutorials. If I want to get that kind of information, I'll read an article or a tutorial.

@vivianehen: I feel when you can free yourself from expectations to fit into a norm how a talk should be delivered, the chances are high to develop your own style. In my experience, humans want to see humans. That means imperfection is not only allowed, but welcomed. If you have something to share, it does not matter if you are a fullblown actress or actor. Just be yourself.


### 9. Overcome self-doubt (I don't have anything to say”)

@bischoffdev: Don't let the thought ‘I don't have anything to add' hold you back. 


### 10. Design for imperfection / accept failure

Rahul Verma: I start from the idea that this talk is going to fail... treat the submitted idea as a hypothesis and let it evolve. 

@topsycreed: For a talk to succeed, it’s not enough to prepare it well. You also need to set the right expectations, promote it to the right audience, and accept that you simply can’t please everyone.

@sharovatov: I've been doing all kinds of sports my whole life, since I was 6. I know how often I think I will perform well at a competition, but then often I don't :D So when going on stage, I tell myself that this the same — sometimes I will perform well, sometimes I won't, and this is ok. It makes me less nervous :)

@vivianehen: I feel when you can free yourself from expectations to fit into a norm how a talk should be delivered, the chances are high to develop your own style. In my experience, humans want to see humans. That means imperfection is not only allowed, but welcomed. If you have something to share, it does not matter if you are a fullblown actress or actor. Just be yourself.

@rytmar: Expectation management: Remember that everyone does not need to like your talk. If you want to please everyone, you may please noone.


### 11. Body language, voice, emotional connection

@PepeDiaz: Your spoken words and body language are key. When you step on stage, the audience expects more than just information. They expect a story. A good speaker entertains, captivates, and takes people on a journey.

@sharovatov: Voice projection drills to build presence. 

@ethfeat: Body language plays a huge role — your posture, how you move on stage, how you use your tone of voice, when you pause and summarize, and even the pace of your speech all shape the audience’s experience. Equally important is eye contact and interaction; the audience should feel engaged, not lulled to sleep.

@KariKakkonen: Talk to the audience (90% time facing the crowd).


### 12. Imposter syndrome
@mesutdurukal: Beat your imposter syndrome. I know a good way for this: Embrace the idea that you are not claiming to teach people something they don't know. You are going to share your story. Ok, now you are safe, no one can better know your story.

@sharovatov: We humans are social creatures, and standing in front of a room full of eyes locked on us taps into some very old instincts. We value social approval, and consciously or not, we're asking ourselves: is my content good enough, or is it just banal? Most people outgrow this fear with experience and gradually become more natural on stage. 


## 13. Don't rush

@RikardEdgren001: It takes months for me to create a great talk; several iterations with the necessary rest for sub-conscious reflection.

@ethfeat: It all starts with an idea — something worth sharing. Once you have that, the real work begins. Crafting a great talk is usually a longer, iterative process. Personally, I keep improving my talks even after I’ve delivered them, so each time the audience hears a more refined version.

@KariKakkonen: Start early enough to have time for a good second look.

@topsycreed: I could hear myself through the mic, it felt unusual, so I intentionally slowed down my delivery. When I later rewatched the recording, the pace turned out to be just right: the audience had enough time to process the information, laugh, and glance at the slides.

@sharovatov: When I listen to a talk of mine done on a "slower" speed, I find it better!

@rytmar: Talking is not just talking, remember "dramatic pauses". Give people time to think and process what you have said


## Storytelling & Talk structure

### 1. Decide on the core message upfront

@PerJonasHermansson: Start by deciding what message you want to convey.

@rytmar: Learnings does not need to be revolutionary, small things are important (and easier to implement).

@rytmar: Create credible story line


### 2. Hero's journey / villain archetype

@rgroetz2: My talks always follow a kind of hero's journey... there's a villain ... and the hero learns and overcomes.


### 3. Hook → Situation → Complication → Solution (SCS)

@rgroetz2: Start with a hook—something surprising, funny, or thought-provoking. 

@anupamck: I try and get my audience to pay attention with a hook... situation, complication, solution. 


### 4. Problem-solution framing

@mesutdurukal: Almost always, it is a problem-solution pattern.

@ethfeat: Beyond the technical content, you need to think about how you’ll explain it in an engaging way. Maybe you use a parallel, a story, or a theme to make it more relatable. Then comes the structure: carefully building the journey from the problem statement to the solution so the audience can follow along with you.

@basdijkstra: A great talk, to me, tells the story of what you have done, what the results were and what you learned in the process. The more failures the better, that's where we all learn.

@rytmar: You need to have some problem you have solved. Something interesting or even unique you have seen happening.


### 5. Adapt language to the audience

@bischoffdev: Be inclusive in your language and adapt your presentation style to your audience.

@KariKakkonen: Basics to align participants, but also going deep on the key topic.

@KariKakkonen: Talk in general, understandable terms, and explain yourself if needed.

@rytmar: Know your audience, talk for them (e.g. talking for leadership is different to testers/developers).


 ### 6. Keep the rythm
 @ethfeat: A strong talk has a clear rhythm: a powerful start, a solid middle, and a memorable finish. Remember, people often judge a presentation less by its content and more by how it made them feel. They want something relatable, something that sticks. Your job is to capture their attention — and keep it until the very last word.

@anupamck: I try and get my audience to pay attention with a hook... situation, complication, solution.


 ### 7. Ways to present
 @KariKakkonen: Use multiple ways of presenting (add a flipchart, video, music, poll, discussion with audience).

 @basdijkstra: With me, it's typically 'if you give me 10 minutes, I'll talk for 10 minutes, if you give me 2 hours, I'll talk for 2 hours'. Most of the talk I come up with on the spot, including the bad jokes. Of course I do some preparation, mostly with  the slides, but as anyone who has seen my slide deck can tell you, I don't spend a lot of time on them :)

 @rytmar: Use humor, if possible and fits to your personality/style
