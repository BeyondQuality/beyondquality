## Introduction

I still remember the first time I stood up to speak at a local tech meetup. My heart was pounding, and I wondered what I’d gotten myself into. As an engineer in the tech industry (and a tester at my inner core), I had always been more comfortable behind a screen than on a stage. Public speaking felt intimidating. Over time, however, I discovered that sharing my ideas in front of an audience was one of the most rewarding decisions of my career. In this short book, I want to share my journey and hard-earned lessons about speaking at meetups and conferences. My goal is to help beginner speakers: engineers, testers, managers, anyone in tech – gain the confidence and know-how to step up to the microphone. 

Public speaking is a skill, not an innate talent. In fact, fear of public speaking is extremely common.  Up to 75% of people [1] experience “glossophobia”, the anxiety around giving speeches. I was definitely one of them. If you feel nervous about speaking, you’re in good company. As the famous Mark Twain quipped, “There are only two types of speakers: the nervous and the liars”. In other words, even seasoned presenters get the jitters. They’ve just learned to cope with it. The good news is that anyone can learn to speak effectively with practice and preparation. I certainly didn’t start out as a confident speaker, but through experience I improve little by little. Each talk becomes easier than the last. 

This guide is organized into three parts. In Part 1, we’ll explore the "Why’s". Why people choose to present and why I decided to start speaking. Knowing your motivation can inspire you to take this challenge. Part 2 is about the "How’s" of preparation. How to craft a great tech presentation, from choosing a topic to rehearsing. Part 3 covers how to deliver your presentation smoothly on the day. Dealing with stage fright, engaging the audience, and handling Q&A. Throughout, I’ll share personal anecdotes, practical tips, a few checklists and the best advice from my colleagues (from complete beginners to speaking gurus). 

Whether you’re a QA tester who’s never spoken beyond team meetings, a junior developer thinking of giving a lightning talk, or a manager asked to present at an industry conference, this guide is for you. By the end, I hope you’ll feel that public speaking in tech is not only doable, but possibly even enjoyable. It’s okay to be nervous. Feeling that way just means you care about doing a good job. With that, let’s start by examining the big question: why even do public speaking in the first place?

## Purpose

Everyone’s reasons for speaking are a little different. Maybe you want to advocate for a cause, like encouraging more diversity in tech. Maybe you’ve discovered a testing approach you’re excited to share with the world. Or maybe you simply want to step outside your comfort zone and grow.

There’s no wrong reason to speak. Only YOUR reason. What matters is that you find it. Because once you understand why you want to speak, that purpose becomes your anchor. It’s what keeps people motivated through the late nights of preparation and helps steady nerves when the spotlight hits.

Knowing your “why” turns public speaking from something intimidating into something meaningful. It transforms the stage from a place of fear into a platform for impact.


--------------------------- Quotes-----------------------------------


Take a moment to think about which of these resonate with you, or add your own. Your story and perspective are unique.  No one else has lived your exact experiences. Even if a topic has been talked about before, your take on it can bring value. I used to worry “I have nothing new to add”, but remember: you have a story to share too! Your viewpoint, whether as a beginner or expert, is always unique and can shine a new light on a subject. Once you find a reason that excites you, hold onto it. It will keep you going through the work of creating and delivering a presentation.

Now that we’ve covered the motivations behind public speaking, let’s get into the practical side: how do you actually prepare a good tech presentation? What steps can you take to craft a talk that will inform and inspire your audience? We’ll explore that next.




## Preparation

Preparing for a talk can feel overwhelming, especially if you’re new to it. I remember staring at a blank page while planning my first conference presentation, not sure where to begin. The key is to break the process into manageable steps. In this section, I’ll share a step-by-step approach to crafting a great presentation, from selecting your topic all the way to rehearsing your finished talk. We’ll also discuss some tips specific to technical talks (like slide design and demos) and ways to get feedback as you prepare. By the end of this part, you should have a checklist of preparation tasks to guide you.



If you’re unsure what to talk about, try a brainstorming exercise. Jot down all the topics or projects you’ve been involved with. Which of these had interesting problems or insights? Another trick: friends and colleagues often see our “expertise” more clearly than we do. I initially thought I had nothing special to share until a colleague said, “What about exploratory sessions you introduced in your team recently? That was cool!” Don’t discount things that seem basic to you. Unique experience with a common technology or process can still teach others something new. And remember, you don’t have to be the world’s foremost expert. If you’re a beginner, you can share a beginner’s perspective; if you’re a professional with many years of experience, you can share hard-earned wisdom. Every level has an audience. The key is to find a story within your context that others can learn from.

Know your audience and goal. Before you start writing your talk, consider who you’ll be speaking to and what you want to achieve. Are you addressing fellow testers at a testing conference? A mix of developers and managers at a tech meetup? Perhaps a non-technical audience (like a client or executives)? Tailor your content to their background and interests. If your audience is very technical, they might appreciate detailed data and code snippets; if it’s mixed (say, developers, QA, and some managers), you might need to start with more general context before diving deep. Sometimes the trick is to explain the topic in a way a child would understand first, then get into technical detail. This approach helps everyone to be on board with the basics before you get into the details. And it doesn’t actually dumb things down, it makes the talk accessible and keeps your credibility with diverse listeners.

Also clarify the purpose of your talk: are you trying to inform (teach the audience something new), persuade (advocate a certain approach or idea), inspire/encourage (motivate people to take action), or simply entertain (e.g. share a funny failure story with lessons)? Many tech talks blend these purposes, but it helps to prioritize. For example, if your goal is to inform, you’ll focus on clear explanations and examples. If it’s to inspire, you might include more personal stories and vision. Defining the goal will shape your tone and structure. Keep the end in mind: what do you want the audience to take away or do after your talk? Write that down and refer to it as your North Star during preparation.

Outline your story. Now that you have a topic and a sense of audience, start outlining your presentation. At its heart, a good talk is a form of storytelling. It has a beginning, middle, and end that takes listeners on a journey. Avoid the temptation to just dump a bunch of facts or slides without narrative, that risks presentation being very. Instead, think about the story arc of your talk: How will you introduce the topic and hook the audience? What challenge or question are you addressing? How did you approach it, what happened? Finally, what did you learn or conclude? Even in a technical presentation, this structure holds. For example, in an embedded testing case study I presented, my arc was: We had a problem (no automated tests for embedded software products) – after interviews with all stakeholders we tried Hardware in the Loop approach (the journey) – we discovered that this works perfectly for our needs  (resolution). By framing it like a story, you keep the audience engaged and make the content more relatable.

Start with a basic outline on paper or a doc. I love to list the key points I want to cover on sticky notes first. It is then easy to arrange them in a logical order. It often helps to think in terms of sections or “chapters”. For instance: 1. Introduction (set the stage, state the problem or topic, why it matters), 2. Main Content (perhaps 2–4 major points or steps, each with supporting examples or data), and 3. Conclusion (wrap up, takeaways, call to action). Under each section, collect bullet points of what you’ll say. This is going to be a  skeleton of the presenttion. Don’t worry about writing sentences yet; focus on the flow of ideas. At this stage, you might realize you have too much.  That’s normal. Trim down to the most important points that support your main message. It’s better to cover a few points well than to overwhelm people with information. Each slide (or each segment of your talk) should convey one main idea clearly. If something doesn’t fit your core message, consider cutting it or saving it for Q&A.

Design visual aids (slides) thoughtfully. In tech talks, slides are common, but they should support your speaking, not steal the show. You are the presenter, not your slides. Keep them simple and legible. Use slides to emphasize key points, show diagrams, code snippets, or images that enhance understanding. Avoid packing slides with text and bullet walls that you will simply read out. That’s a quick way to lose audience attention. A good rule of thumb: don’t put your speaking script on the slides. Use minimal text, just enough to jog the audience’s memory or highlight keywords. Leave just some cues. People can’t read dense text and listen to you at the same time, so don’t make them choose.

For code or technical content on slides, make sure it’s readable. Use large fonts and high contrast colors. Many speakers have learned (sometimes the hard way) that tiny text is illegible beyond the first few rows. Never say “I know this code is hard to read”. Instead, format it so it is readable or summarize the code’s purpose verbally. Use highlighting or arrows on slides if you want to draw attention to part of a diagram or code snippet. If you have live demos, prepare them carefully (and have a backup plan in case the demo fails or the internet is down). It is nice to have a one-click reset for demos, like a script to restore your initial state, so if something goes wrong you can quickly recover. It’s also wise to have screenshots of your demo as a backup within your slides, just in case the demo gods misbehave.

Talk’s content is more important than flashy slides. Don’t spend 90% of your prep time making slides pretty at the expense of practicing your delivery. A simple deck with clear, uncluttered visuals is usually best. One more tip: if possible, test your slides on the actual equipment or at least a similar setup before the talk. Different projectors can make colors look washed out, and room size affects font visibility. I try to check my slides on a projector the day before or morning of the talk, to ensure people at the back can see them. If you spot an issue (e.g., a diagram is too small), you can adjust in time.

Practice, practice, practice. Once you have your talk structured and your slides ready, the most important preparation step is rehearsal. This is non-negotiable, especially for beginners. Even experienced speakers practice.  It’s how to get comfortable with the material and discover any timing issues or tongue-twister phrases. Start by running through the talk by yourself. You can do it in front of a mirror or even record yourself with your phone. Yes, it feels awkward, but it works. Sometimes when I do the run-through alone, I find that some parts that seemed clear on paper actually came out confusing when spoken. Rehearsing and recording my speech gives a chance to fix this issues. Recording the speech also allows to time as well as possible to ensure that the talk fits in the allotted slot. Conferences typically give some time limits (say 30 minutes, or 45, etc., plus Q&A). It’s critical to respect that. Running overtime can disrupt the whole schedule and irritate organizers and audience alike. Aim to actually finish a bit under time in practice, to allow some room for unforeseen issues or shange of speaking speed because of stress. It’s better to end slightly early than to rush at the end or be forced to cut material on the fly.

After solo practice, if you can, do a practice talk for a friendly audience. This could be two or three colleagues, or your family, or a local meetup group. Invite them to be honest with feedback. In fact, you might assign one person to focus on your delivery (voice, body language) and another to focus on the content (were your points clear, did they understand the technical parts). If you have a mentor or friend who is an experienced speaker, ask them to watch your rehearsal. They might catch things you never considered. When I rehearsed my talk for a coworker, she pointed out that I was saying “um” a lot and pacing nervously. The things I wasn’t aware of. With that feedback, I consciously practiced pausing instead of filling every silence, and it made a big difference. Consider also joining a public speaking club or group to get regular practice in a supportive environment. The more you practice, the more your confidence will grow. It’s like training a muscle.

Prepare for the big day. As your talk date approaches, take care of a few final details. Make sure you have everything you need: your laptop (with appropriate display adapter if needed), a backup of your slides on a USB drive or cloud or in your mailbox, any demo files, and maybe a clicker/remote if you prefer one. Have a “talk day kit”. Mine includes a bottle of water, some throat lozenges (in case my throat gets dry), and a notecard with a few key points or the outline (just as a safety net if I blank out). Get a good night’s sleep before if possible. On the morning of the talk, give yourself time to arrive early at the venue. Rushing will only add to anxiety. I like to visit the room beforehand: I go up on stage when it’s empty, familiarize myself with the space, test the microphone, and click through a couple of slides to ensure they display properly. This little ritual makes the environment feel less alien when it’s showtime, so my body feels more at ease in the space. If the conference has a sound check or speaker ready room, definitely take advantage of it.

Finally, mentally prepare yourself. I have a routine where I find a quiet spot, do a few deep breaths (I prefer doing quadrant breathing excercise) and maybe a power-pose (standing confidently, hands on hips like a superhero) for a minute to boost my confidence. It might sound silly, but studies suggest power-poses can reduce stress hormones and help to feel more confident. I’ll also remind myself of one truth: I’m here to share something valuable, not to be perfect. Shifting focus to the message (“I’m helping the audience by teaching them X”) rather than my performance helps reducing stress. The audience wants to learn from you, not judge you harshly.

With preparation done, you’ve already won half the battle. At this point, you know your material and have set yourself up for success. Still, the moment of stepping on stage can be nerve-wracking. In the next part, we’ll talk about delivering your presentation. How to handle those nerves and make your time on stage as smooth as possible.




## Presentation

The big day has arrived. You’ve prepared a solid presentation and practiced it well. Now comes the part that most first-time speakers find the scariest: actually delivering the talk in front of a live audience. In this section, we’ll cover techniques to help doing presentation with confidence and clarity. This includes managing stage fright, engaging with your audience during the talk, handling any hiccups that arise, and navigating the Q&A session if there is one. Even the best-prepared talk can fall flat if delivered poorly, so it’s worth focusing on these delivery skills. The good news is, you don’t need to be an entertainer, a clown or have a golden voice. Being clear, authentic, empathetic to audience’s needs goes a long way.

Dealing with nerves: First, let’s address the elephant in the room – stage fright. If your heart is pounding and your palms are sweaty as you’re about to go on, know that this is completely normal. I still get nervous before every talk, just as many experienced speakers do. The adrenaline can even be helpful, giving you energy and alertness. The goal isn’t to eliminate nerves (remember Twain’s quote about “nervous or lying” ?), but to prevent them from derailing you. One thing that helps is a simple breathing exercise: inhale deeply for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6-8 seconds (square breathing). Do a few rounds of that backstage or even on stage while someone introduces you. It calms the racing heart. Another trick is smiling as you begin. It sounds odd, but forcing a smile releases tension and makes you appear confident. I often start with a smile and a “Hello everyone, thank you for being here”, which also warms up my voice.

When you get on stage, take a moment to get comfortable. Adjust the microphone, take a breath, and make eye contact with a friendly face in the audience. In a small room, you can quickly greet the audience with a show of hands (“How many of you are using coding assistants?”) to create engagement. In a larger room, just find a few faces that seem attentive and imagine you’re speaking to them. This makes it feel like a conversation and can calm the nerves. As you start speaking and get into your material, the nerves usually ease within the first couple of minutes. I find that once I’m past my introduction and telling my first story or point, I almost forget about being nervous. I get caught up in explaining the content.

Speaking clearly and with presence: During the talk, focus on clarity. Speak a bit slower than you do in casual conversation, and project your voice. In a large room, use the microphone to your advantage. Keep it an appropriate distance from your mouth (test this beforehand). Articulate your words, but don’t worry about a brief stumble or mispronunciation; just keep going. If you realize you’re talking too fast (a common side effect of nervousness), consciously pause and take a breath. Pausing is powerful. It gives the audience time to absorb information and makes speaker sound more confident. And if you lose your train of thought, a pause with a sip of water can buy you a moment to regain it. Dry mouth is another lovely side effect of adrenaline, and a quick sip can prevent coughing and also serve as a deliberate pause.

Try to use natural body language. This means: stand up straight, don’t lock your knees, and use your hands to gesture if it helps you explain (but avoid repetitive moves). Some movement is good.  Walking a few steps across the stage can keep energy up, but don’t pace nervously or rock back and forth. Move with purpose, perhaps to transition between points or to point at the screen if needed. When you stand still, plant your feet firmly to appear grounded. If you have a podium, you can stand behind it, but be careful not to hide or slouch. If you want the audience to focus on a slide, stop and look at it yourself; when you want them back on you, step forward or make a gesture or a move. Above all, try to appear engaged and enthusiastic. Let your voice show a bit of excitement when appropriate, and smile or show emotion when telling a story. Enthusiasm is infectious. If you seem like you care about the topic, the audience is more likely to care too.

Handling the unexpected: No matter how much you practice, real life can throw curveballs. Maybe the projector fails, or a demo crashes, or you blank out on what’s next. It happens to everyone at some point. The key is to stay calm and not panic or apologize excessively. If a slide freezes or something technical goes wrong, you can ask the audience for a brief moment, or even lighten the mood: “Looks like the demo gremlins are at it again”. Audiences are very forgiving of technical issues as long as you communicate. This is where your backup preparation helps (you brought those screenshots, right?). If you completely forget what comes next, it’s okay to take a quick glance at your notes or the slide on the screen to remind you. You can also ask the audience a question related to your last point. This gives a few seconds to gather thoughts while someone answers. Importantly, keep perspective: you’re not performing brain surgery up there. If you mess up a bit, it’s not the end of the world. In other words, don’t take yourself too seriously on stage. A touch of humor at your own mistakes can engage the audience.

I recall a time I skipped a couple of slides by accident. Instead of panicking, I joked “Oops, I guess even my slides want to jump to the next point!” got a small laugh, and I simply backtracked. These moments make us human. What matters is recovering and continuing. If you find yourself really off track, take a breath and summarize where you were: “So, as I was saying about X, the main point is Y, and now I’ll move on to Z”. The audience often won’t even realize something went wrong if you don’t emphasize it too much. Nerves may spike if something unexpected happens, but rely on the fact that you know your material (you practiced, after all). Trust yourself and keep going.

Engaging the audience: A great presentation feels like a conversation, not a monologue. Even if the format doesn’t allow the audience to speak up during the talk, you can still engage them. Simple techniques include asking rhetorical questions (“We all hate flaky tests, right?”), or a quick show of hands (“Raise your hand if you’ve had a deployment go wrong”). These tricks get people mentally involved and can re-capture attention if it’s drifting. Another method is to incorporate a very short story or example that people can relate to. For instance, I often share a one-minute anecdote like, “I remember a night when our release was delayed by a single missing semicolon…” – it gets a smile or at least empathy from fellow engineers. Relatable examples make your points more memorable.

Make sure to maintain eye contact. If direct eye contact is too nerve-wracking, you can look at foreheads or just above heads. It appears like eye contact from the audience’s perspective. Try not to speak to the screen (common when speakers keep turning to look at their slides). Glance briefly if you need to, but then face the audience again to talk. Vary your voice tone and volume a bit to avoid monotony. For example, lower your voice to a whisper when sharing a “secret” insight, or raise it to convey excitement at a breakthrough. These little variations keep people’s attention. It can also be effective to pause intentionally before an important point. It creates a sense that something important is coming, so listeners make attention.

Handling Q&A: If your talk includes a Q&A segment at the end (common at conferences), it helps to prepare mentally for it. The Q&A can be the most unpredictable part. First, when you finish your presentation, repeat the question each time someone asks one (especially if there are no audience mics). This ensures everyone in the room hears it and gives you an extra second to formulate your answer. When answering, if you know the answer, great – keep it concise and to the point. If you don’t know or the question stumps you, it’s perfectly fine to admit that. You can say, “That’s a great question. I’m not sure offhand, but I’d love to dig into it and get back to you”.  Or throw the question back: “Has anyone in the audience encountered that scenario?”. Often, someone else might have insight, turning it into a discussion. It’s okay not to know everything. As one discussion noted, if you really don’t know an answer, it’s absolutely acceptable to say so. It doesn’t make you a bad speaker. Honesty builds trust.

Sometimes you might get a long or off-topic question. In that case, politely interject if needed and suggest discussing it afterward (“I think that’s a bit beyond today’s scope, but I’d be happy to chat with you after the session”). This keeps the Q&A on track. If someone is aggressively challenging, stay calm and respond politely. It’s rare, but it can happen. Remember, you are the authority during your talk, because you’re the one who prepared and spoke on the subject. So even if answering questions feels like you’re on the spot, realize that you’ve earned the audience’s respect by being up there. Take questions as a sign that people were listening and interested.

After the last question, thank the audience again for their time. It’s good to end on a note of gratitude or a final encouragement related to your topic (“I hope you’ll go back and try these testing ideas with your teams”) or a call to action ("Now it's your turn to make our apps more secure"). Once the talk is officially done, take a breath. You did it! If people come up to you to chat, try to be available and engage with them; this is where networking and deeper discussions happen. I often learn a ton from those one-on-one questions and comments after a talk.

--------------------------- Quotes-----------------------------------

Delivering a presentation is as much about mindset as it is about technique. If you believe in your message and care about helping the audience understand it, that intent will shine through. Don’t aim for a “perfect” talk; aim for a useful and authentic one. In most cases, people won’t remember minor stumbles, but they will remember your attitude and the value they got from your talk. After it’s over, congratulate yourself. You did something that most people find daunting.


 ## Final Thoughts

Looking back on my public speaking journey, I’m struck by how much I have grown from it. What started as a single meetup presentation turned into a series of talks at larger conferences, panels and even keynotes. Along the way I went from dreading the stage to genuinely enjoying the opportunity to share and connect. Don’t get me wrong. I still get butterflies before a talk, and I still have much to learn. But the fact that I can now stand in front of hundreds of people and tell a story about technology (and actually have fun doing it) is something my younger self would have never believed.

If you take one thing from this guide, I hope it’s the confidence that you have something valuable to say and that you can say it in a public forum. Tech industry needs exchange of ideas. We need voices from all backgrounds: developers, testers, managers, newbies, veterans - people of all genders and cultures sharing their unique experiences.

It’s okay to start small. You don’t have to aim for a major conference right away. Perhaps begin with an internal presentation at your company or a casual talk at a local meetup. These smaller settings are fantastic for trying out your material and getting comfortable. In fact, practicing at meetups or in front of teammates is how I built up to conference speaking. Celebrate those small wins. Each one will make you more ready for a bigger stage.

Also, don’t hesitate to seek out mentors or allies. In my case, I had colleagues and friends who give me feedback and cheer me on. There are also speaker mentorship programs (some conferences have them for first-time speakers) and communities where you can find support. Many experienced speakers are happy to help newcomers with proposals and practice sessions. You’re not alone in this.

One of the wonderful things I discovered is that the act of presenting often gives back more than you put in. I’ve learned new ideas from audience questions, received feedback that improved my own work, gained broader perspective from discussions after my talks. Speaking has made me a better listener and teacher. It’s even improved my regular work communications. If you can explain something clearly on stage, you’ll be better at explaining things in meetings or emails too. In short, the benefits echo into many areas of professional and personal life.

Now, you might still have some doubts or fears. You might think, “What if I fail? What if people think I’m not expert enough?”. These thoughts are natural. Doing it, even if it’s not perfect – is infinitely better than not trying at all. Every speaker you admire started somewhere, probably with an awkward or average talk. They improved by doing it again. And if you give a talk that doesn’t go as well as you hoped, it’s not a failure. It’s a draft for your next, better talk.

To conclude, I want to encourage you to take that leap. If an opportunity arises to speak – be it a short talk at a meetup or a conference presentation – say yes. Or better yet, create an opportunity: propose a topic to an event or start a knowledge-sharing session at work. It will be nerve-wracking the first time, no doubt. But it will also be empowering. You’ll likely come off the stage thinking, “Wow, I actually did it!” and that feeling is awesome.

I hope the insights and tips I’ve shared in this book help demystify the process of public speaking in tech. It’s not reserved for geniuses or extroverts. It’s for anyone with a passion to share and a willingness to learn. Your talks don’t have to be grand or groundbreaking. Some of the most impactful talks are simple stories of a problem and a solution, told honestly. As long as you speak with sincerity and keep the audience in mind, you will do well.

Thank you for reading through and allowing me to share my story. Now it’s your turn to write the next chapter of your story. What message do you have for the world of tech? What experience could you share that might help others? I’m certain there is something. I encourage you to step up and let your voice be heard. Who knows – maybe someday I’ll be in the audience at a conference, listening to your talk and nodding along.

Happy speaking, and see you on stage!
