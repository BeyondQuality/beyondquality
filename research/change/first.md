Implementation science has already solved the "how do we organize barriers?" problem, with frameworks designed specifically to classify why adoption fails across contexts. Here's my initial attempt on collecting the necessary information.

1. [CFIR](https://cfirguide.org/) organizes determinants into 5 domains (intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of individuals, process), here's CFIR's construct example on [Implementation Climate](https://cfirguide.org/constructs-old/implementation-climate/)

2. [Normalization Process Theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1748-5908-4-29) focuses on the work people do to **embed and sustain** a new practice as "how we do things here".

Klein & Sorra in their [The Challenge of Innovation Implementation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259164) paper define implementation climate as whether innovation use is **expected, supported, and rewarded**, and link it to outcomes like avoidance vs commitment. Also related "[meaning and measurement of implementation climate](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1748-5908-6-78)"

3. **[Threat-rigidity](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392337)** — under threat, info processing restricts and control constricts (bad for learning/rebudgeting).  

4. **[Psychological safety](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Edmondson%20Psychological%20safety.pdf)** — safety predicts learning behaviors (speaking up, reporting errors, experimentation). **[Organizational silence](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259200)** — silence is a systemic barrier to change and development.

5. Various decision "distortions":

    - **[Prospect theory](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Behavioral_Decision_Theory/Kahneman_Tversky_1979_Prospect_theory.pdf)** — loss aversion/reference dependence: immediate certain losses outweigh probabilistic future gains.  

    - **[Status quo bias](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/1_J_Risk_Uncertainty_7_%28Samuelson%29.pdf)** — people disproportionately stick with the current allocation ("do nothing" default).

6. Incentives, targets, and metric corruption:

    - **[Kerr: "Rewarding A while hoping for B"](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Kerr_Folly_of_rewarding_A_while_hoping_for_B.pdf)**, **[Campbell](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27521792.pdf) / [Goodhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)'s law** — reward systems often reinforce the opposite of what is intended really. For instance, if managers are rewarded for velocity, they wouldn't agree to slow down short-term to get preventive measures done right so that they could increase speed and quality later.

7. Politics:

    - **[Weick: Sensemaking](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/sensemaking-in-organizations/book4988)** — under ambiguity, organizations coordinate via shared narratives; misaligned frames stall action.

    - **[Pfeffer: Managing with Power](https://books.google.com/books/about/Managing_with_Power.html?id=xbEN74KGZgsC)** — implementation is influence + overcoming resistance; "good decision" != behavior change.  

    - **[Hannan & Freeman structural inertia](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095567)** — orgs are biased toward stability; change constrained by entrenched structures/routines.  

8. Change process failure modes:

    - **[Kotter](https://hbr.org/1995/05/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail-2)** — recurring reasons transformations fail (urgency, coalition, barriers, reinforcement, etc.).  

    - **[Armenakis et al. readiness](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Achilles-Armenakis/publication/211381460_Creating_Readiness_for_Organizational_Change/links/00b7d51bc166dd4dce000000/Creating-Readiness-for-Organizational-Change.pdf)** — readiness is a precursor to resistance/adoption; assess/build readiness before rollout.  

    - **[Oreg (2006)](https://bschool-en.huji.ac.il/sites/default/files/businesshe/files/oreg_2006_ejwop.pdf))** — resistance is multifaceted and associated with both personality and organizational context.
