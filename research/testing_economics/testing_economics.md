# Economics of testing

## Testing as a risk-mitigation investment

Testing is an appraisal activity that provides information about risks and reduces their likelihood or impact when failures are found and fixed.

Like any other activity, testing consumes resources (effort, tools, and time).

In economics, investment is defined as "_any asset obtained at a cost, on the expectation that it will deliver future value greater than its initial cost._".

Testing fits into this definition: it is an investment made today to reduce the probability and impact of costly failures tomorrow, thereby optimizing future outcomes.

Since testing is an investment, its economic return can never be guaranteed. At best, we can estimate the expected benefits, but the value of testing lies in reducing the probability and impact of costly failures, and these events may or may not occur. Testing can be compared to insurance or preventive healthcare: we spend resources today because the risks of not doing so are far greater than the cost of investment.

Recognizing that we do need to invest, the next question becomes where to allocate those resources. Budgets are never limitless, and the law of diminishing returns means that simply "doing more testing" is not an efficient strategy. Instead, we must treat testing like an investment portfolio: selecting a mix of testing activities that provides the maximum reduction in risk for the resources available.

To build such a portfolio, we must first identify which risks matter most. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 makes this explicit: risk identification is the first step in test planning. Similarly, ISO/IEC 25010 provides a structured set of quality characteristics that can serve as categories for defining risk areas. By starting from risks, we can then make deliberate, economically sound decisions about which testing activities to invest in and to what extent, ensuring that the portfolio aligns with the organization’s tolerance for risk and its business priorities.
